      "content": "There's strong disagreement among Democratic contenders for the US presidency about legalizing cannabis and it's been a flashpoint in their televised debates so far. Currently the leading contender in the race won't be drawn either way. He wants more evidence about whether using it could act as a 'gateway' to the use of harder drugs before it's legalized throughout the US. 'Before I legalize it nationally,' said Biden, 'I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.'"

      "content": "Milk plays a crucial role in the life of all mammals, right from birth. But some say that drinking another mammal's milk is unnecessary, unnatural, even unhealthy. As the only animal to drink the milk of another species, humans have an unusual relationship with the white stuff. Most other animals are weaned off milk in infancy, once we start to need more complex foods. So why do humans keep drinking it?"

We often view our sleeplessness as a badge of pride \u2013 a measure of our impossibly hectic schedules. Thomas Edison, Margaret Thatcher, Martha Stewart and Donald Trump have all famously claimed to get by on just four or five hours' sleep a night \u2013 much less than the seven to nine hours recommended to most adults."
